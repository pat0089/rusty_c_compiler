# Rusty C compiler

### This is a C subset compiler in Rust this time! 

I have been working on learning Rust more thoroughly, and to do this, I am going to be remaking a lot of my projects in Rust, as I have really been swayed by various Youtube channels to give it a go. 
I have also been learning some more functional programming, so I think this time I could really get this going much quicker, especially using the match statements of Rust.
